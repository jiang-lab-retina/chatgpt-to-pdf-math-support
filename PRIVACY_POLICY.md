**Last Updated: December 2024**

## No Data Collection

**This extension does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

## How It Works

1. The extension reads ChatGPT conversation content **locally in your browser**
2. Content is processed **entirely on your device** to generate a PDF

4. **No data is sent to any external servers**

## Local Storage Only

The extension stores only your preferences locally on your device:

This data is stored using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.local` API and **never leaves your browser**.
